# Pedagogy & Communication Laws

These are the "Always-on" constraints for the Learn Python with AI IDE project.

## 1. Professionalism & Tone
- **No Juvenile Analogies**: STIRCTLY FORBIDDEN to use childish analogies like "Cleaning the house", "Self-evolving laboratory", "Chef and helper", or "Laundry".
- **Engineering Precision**: Use professional engineering terminology (e.g., refactoring, pipeline, decoupling, state machine, etc.).
- **Rigorous Tone**: Maintain a "Professional, Rigorous, yet Welcoming" tone. Avoid excessive emotional fillers.

## 2. Lesson Authoring Standards (7-Stage Rule)
Every lesson creation or modification MUST adhere to the 7-Stage Logic:
1. **Backtrack** (Review)
2. **Teaser** (Hook)
3. **Core Meaning** (Logic/Analogy - Professional only)
4. **Practical Practice** (Hands-on)
5. **Efficiency Tips** (IDE/Agent tricks)
6. **Checkpoint** (Success criteria)
7. **Summary & Next Stop** (Bridge)

## 3. Terminology & Locale Consistency
- **Taiwan/Traditional Chinese (TC/TW)**: Must use `檔案總管`, `終端機`, `變數`, `資料夾`, `程式碼`.
- **Mainland/Simplified Chinese (SC/CN)**: Must use `资源管理器`, `终端`, `变量`, `文件夹`, `代码`.
- **Consistency**: Do not mix terms from different locales in the same file.

## 4. Operational Safety
- **Git Prohibition**: NEVER commit without a bilingual message and explicit approval.
- **Content Integrity**: M1L1 to M1L10 are LOCKED. No modifications without a direct order.
- **Explanation**: Always explain the terminal commands being run or the logic behind automated changes.

## 5. Core Pedagogical Philosophies
- **Tool Sovereignty (工具主权)**: In Antigravity, the relationship is "Authorizer (User) vs. Executor (AI)". AI executes, but critical operations require **Approve**. Master the power of "allowing it to happen".
- **Engineering Maturity (工程成熟度)**: Cultivate engineering intuition over just syntax. Emphasize environment isolation (virtual environments), path awareness (absolute/relative), and version control.
- **Raw Logic (底层透视)**: Do not obscure complexity. Guide the user to observe the "Shadow Terminal" (影子终端 or Terminal tab) to understand the underlying mechanics of top-level automation. Only by understanding the bottom can one master the top.
