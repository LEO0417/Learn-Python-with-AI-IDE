description: Create a new lesson file based on the standard 7-stage structure.
---

To create a new lesson, please provide the Module number, Lesson number, and Title.
I will then:
1.  Verify the Module and Lesson order.
2.  Use the `lesson-ops` skill (Scaffold section) to create the base structure.
3.  Apply the teaching philosophy from `lesson-authoring-guide`.

Steps:
1. Identify the target path (e.g., `curriculum/Learn Python with AI IDE/Module_X/.../M1LY_Title.md`).
2. Generate content following the 7-stage structure.
3. Once finished, run `/check-continuity` to ensure it fits the existing curriculum.
