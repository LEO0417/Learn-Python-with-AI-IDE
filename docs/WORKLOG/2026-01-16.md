## 1. Session Summary
Today's session focused on finalizing Module 1 Lesson 7 (L7) by refining its flow, synchronizing the Traditional Chinese (TW) version, and establishing a robust terminology management system. We also implemented strict content-locking rules to preserve the finalized foundations of Module 1 and created a trilingual "Video Description" registry for YouTube/B站 distribution.

## 2. Technical & Curriculum Changes
### Curriculum Updates
- **Branding Sync (L1-L7)**: Uniformly updated all finalized lesson titles to the new format (e.g., `用AI IDE学Python｜第一章 第一课｜...`).
- **M1L7 (Simplified Chinese)**: Refined transitions, emphasized AI asset management, and synchronized terminology using corner brackets 「 」 for key metaphors.
- **M1L7 (Traditional Chinese)**: Fully synchronized with SC version using Taiwan localized terms (e.g., "檔案總管", "終端機").
- **M1L6**: Updated title and conclusion to align with the new standard branding and M1L7 transition.
- **M1L10 (SC/TC)**: Fixed typos (e.g., "we 选择", "驗念") and aligned technical terms.
- **Cleanup**: Deleted 18 legacy files (M1_1-9 and older L7 versions) to maintain a clean directory.

### Tooling & Infrastructure (Agentic Skills)
- **New Skill: `chinese-terminology-checker`**: Created GLOSSARY.md to ensure SC/TC consistency.
- **Enhanced Skill: `lesson-continuity-check`**: Added terminology synchrony, narrative logic checks, and "Title Snapshot" updates.
- **Enhanced Skill: `lesson-authoring-guide`**: Implemented **Section 4: Content Locking & Immortality**. Marked M1L1 through M1L7 as **FINALIZED**.
- **Workflow: `cc.md`**: Updated the continuity check workflow to include title snapshot generation.
- **Registry**: Created `docs/FINALIZED_LESSONS_TITLES.md` containing SC/TC/EN titles and trilingual video descriptions for YouTube/B站.

## 3. Key Decisions
- **Trilingual Distribution**: Decided to maintain a centralized registry for marketing/video descriptions to ensure consistency across social platforms.
- **Immutable Core**: Established a "Freeze Rule" for finalized lessons (L1-L7) to prevent accidental regressions.
- **Branding Uniformity**: Switched to pipe `｜` and corner brackets 「 」 for a more professional, premium visual identity in titles.

## 4. Next Steps
- Proceed with M1L8 development (AI Sidebar Agent).
- Continue appending new trilingual descriptions to the registry as lessons finalize.
