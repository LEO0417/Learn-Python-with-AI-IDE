## Curriculum Refinement
- **M1L8 (AI Sidebar Agent)**: 
    - Re-authored to emphasize "Agentic Workflow" (Native API vs. Terminal).
    - Integrated real-world log observation for Task 3 (multitasking & terminal relocation).
    - Refined recap into a mindset-oriented conclusion.
- **M1L9 (Human-AI Loop)**:
    - Structured around 3 core experiments: Terminal Truth, Intent Correction, and Plain-language Review.
    - Simplified UI instructions to focus on "Run" vs "Apply".
    - Standardized bookends (Backtrack, Teaser, Recap, Next Stop).
- **M1L10 (Final Review)**:
    - Created placeholder for the Module 1 grand finale.
- **TC Sync**: Full terminology alignment for Taiwanese Mandarin (介面/呼叫/終端機).

## Pedagogy & Standards
- **MODULE_1_PEDAGOGY.md**: 
    - Formalized the "Standard Bookends + Organic Middle" lesson structure.
    - Updated recap/teaser guidelines to be narrative and ideological rather than mechanical.
- **FINALIZED_LESSONS_TITLES.md**: Corrected ordering and integrated L8 metadata.

## Engineering
- Verified term consistency across all Module 1 lesson files.
- Automated title/description synchronization.
