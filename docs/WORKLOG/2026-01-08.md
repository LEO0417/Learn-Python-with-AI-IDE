## M1L5 (Script Engineering) Finalization & Refinement

Today marks the finalization of Module 1, Lesson 5. We performed several deep-dive refinements to improve cross-platform clarity, pedagogical flow, and engineering rigor.

### Key Refinements:
1.  **Path & Visualization**:
    *   Integrated `pwd` command into the workspace setup section to help learners visualize the "Absolute Path" (绝对地址) of their project.
2.  **Mac User Experience (TextEdit)**:
    *   Added specific instructions for macOS users to use **TextEdit (文本编辑)**.
    *   Crucially added the "Plain Text Mode" requirement (`Shift+Command+T`) to prevent RTF issues common with new coders.
3.  **Formal Script Definition**:
    *   Formally introduced the term **"Python Script" (Python 脚本)** in Section 4 to give learners a sense of engineering nomenclature once they've proven the file's plain-text nature.
4.  **Pedagogical Restructuring**:
    *   Moved the **"REPL vs Script"** comparison table to the end of the "Missing Result" experiment. This provides a stronger summary effect by following immediately after the learner experiences the lack of automatic printing in scripts.
5.  **IDE Expansion**:
    *   Expanded the conclusion's introduction to IDEs, providing the full name: **Integrated Development Environment (集成开发环境)**.
    *   Strengthened the "Cockpit" metaphor to set expectations for M1L6 as a centralized control center.
6.  **Knowledge Curse Compliance**:
    *   Removed premature mentions of "Variables" and "Homework" to keep the focus strictly on script mechanics and `print()` necessity.
    *   Abstracted these correction principles into the `ACTION_GUIDE.md` for future reference.

### Documentation Updates:
*   Updated `MODULE_1_TASKS.md`: Marked M1L5 as finalized.
*   Updated `ACTION_GUIDE.md`: Added M1L5 to the "Immutable Foundation" list.

## Next Steps:
*   Begin planning and drafting **Module 1 Lesson 6: What Is IDE**.
*   Focus on the integration aspect: how the IDE "plugs into" the `ai_course` conda environment (recall M1L4).
