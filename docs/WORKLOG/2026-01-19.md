## Technical & Curriculum Changes
- **M1L9 (Human-AI Loop)**: Refined pedagogy to focus on "Intent Alignment" (Alignment) rather than traditional bug fixing. Introduced a "Bilingual Timer" experiment to demonstrate high-level interaction and interaction design (Start Confirmation).
- **M1L10 (Global Review)**: Structural overhaul to serve as a comprehensive retrospective of Module 1. Unified L1-L9 core concepts (Cognition, Interaction, Isolation, Engineering Standards, Agent Workflow) and bridged to Module 2.
- **Title Synchronization**: Simplified M1L10 title to "Module 1 全局复盘" and synchronized all lesson previews in L8 and L9 to maintain consistency.
- **SC/TW Parity**: Ensured 1:1 content parity for simplified (SC) and traditional (TW) Chinese versions of M1L8, M1L9, and M1L10, including terminology localization (e.g., "列印", "終端機").
- **Metadata Update**: Updated `docs/FINALIZED_LESSONS_TITLES.md` with finalized titles and descriptions for M1L9 and M1L10.

## Key Decisions
- Shifted the learning focus from "correcting AI mistakes" to "guiding AI for aesthetic and functional fit".
- Emphasized "White-box Auditing" (白话审计) as a core capability for students in the AI era.
- Decided on the "Global Review" naming for M1L10 to stay grounded and professional.
