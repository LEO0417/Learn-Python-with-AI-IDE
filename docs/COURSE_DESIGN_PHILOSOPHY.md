# Course Design Philosophy (课程设计最高纲领)

> **"Slow is smooth, smooth is fast." —— 慢即是快**

This document serves as the "Supreme Program" (最高纲领) for the *Learn Python with AI IDE* curriculum. It enshrines the original vision, the pedagogical philosophy, and the strategic roadmap for the course.

## 1. The Origin (初心)

The inception of this course was driven by a desire to share the **Stanford CS146S: Modern Software Developer** curriculum. 
- **The Value**: CS146S is a cutting-edge course worth mastering.
- **The Problem**: It has a high barrier to entry for beginners. Week 1 alone requires knowledge of Python, APIs, and cloud interactions.
- **The Failed Approach**: Initially, we considered "patchwork teaching" (clamping rice)—teaching only the specific snippets needed for CS146S. This proved inefficient and fragile.
- **The Solution**: A systematic, foundational course that builds the "muscle" required to tackle CS146S and beyond, using the very tools (AI IDEs) that define modern engineering.

## 2. Core Philosophy (核心教育理念)

### 2.1 Systematic Foundation vs. Patchwork (体系化 vs 碎片化)
We reject "just-in-time" learning for foundations. Like eating a meal, snacking (patchwork tutorials) might curb hunger, but it doesn't build a healthy body. We choose the "dumb way" (笨办法)—systematically rebuilding the foundation from the ground up—because it is the most efficient path in the long run.

### 2.2 AI-Native Learning (AI 原生学习)
We are not teaching "Traditional Python". We are teaching **"Python in the AI Era"**.
- **The Medium**: We learn *with* the AI IDE.
- **The Method**: We use Python to run Python, but with an AI Agent as a co-pilot.
- **The Loop**: The student must always be in the **Human-AI Loop**. The goal is not just to write code, but to verify, guide, and architect code with AI.

## 3. The Three-Stage Rocket (三级火箭战略)

The curriculum is structured into three distinct modules, each with a specific mission.

### Module 1: The AI-Ready Engineer (Mental Breakthrough)
* **Goal**: **Overcome Fear (破冰)**.
* **Mission**: Remove the psychological barrier of the "black box" (Terminal) and the "complex tool" (IDE).
* **Content**: Terminal mastery, Environment (Conda), Script Engineering, Standard Workbench, AI Collaboration (Sidebar).
* **Outcome**: The student is no longer afraid of the tools. They are "Ready".

### Module 2: Python Foundation with AI (Capability Building)
* **Goal**: **Build Courage & Capacity (底气与能力)**.
* **Mission**: Master the communication with the AI Agent while learning Python core concepts.
* **Reference**: Aligned with the 4-Module structure of Andrew Ng's Python course (Basics, Automation, Files, Data).
* **Key Differentiator**: We don't just "learn lists"; we learn "how to ask the AI to build lists and how to verify them."
* **Outcome**: The student has the courage and ability to use the IDE for self-directed learning. They can "fish" for themselves.

### Module 3: The Stanford Bridge (Specialization)
* **Goal**: **Practical Application (实战特训)**.
* **Mission**: Specifically target the skills required for **Stanford CS146S Week 1**.
* **Content**:
    - "Specialized" Python topics (APIs, Requests, JSON).
    - Advanced AI Interaction Skills (Prompt Engineering for Code).
    - Deep dive into latest AI IDE features/skills.
* **Outcome**: The student seamlessly transitions into the Stanford case studies, fully equipped to succeed.

## 4. Workflows & Collaboration (工作流)

To ensure this philosophy is upheld:
1.  **Reference First**: Before writing M2 content, always check `references/ng_lesson` to align with the standard curriculum structure.
2.  **Context Check**: Every lesson must reinforce the "Human-AI Loop".
3.  **Bridge Check**: M2 lessons must explicitly build towards the capability needed for M3 (Stanford Week 1).
